					<p>Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen men - Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was giving directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.</p>

He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.</p>

The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky&#8211;a couple of hundred people, perhaps.</p>

					<p>Besides that, there was quite a heap of bicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowd&#8211;one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others.</p>
